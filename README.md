In this walkthrough, I show you how to build Candy Crush in pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS following Ania kubow's tutorial @ania-kubow

This walkthrough is great as it will show you how to drag and drop elements in JavaScript. This is a very popular element in building many JavaScript projects.

In addition to this, we will also be practising using inbuilt methods such as:

* addEventListener()
* setAttribute()
* setInterval()
* some()
* every()
* forEach()
* includes()
* contains()
* add()
* remove()
* createElement()
* appendChild()
* push()
* continue
